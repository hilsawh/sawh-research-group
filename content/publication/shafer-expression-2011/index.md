abstract: Development in the frog, Xenopus laevis, requires the utilization of yolk
  glyco-lipo-proteins in a temporally- and spatially-dependent manner. The metabolism
  of the yolk produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a potent reactive oxygen species
  (ROS). Peroxiredoxins (prdxs) are a family of six anti-oxidant enzymes that, amongst
  other roles, reduce H2O2. Prdxs reduce H2O2 through a thiol-redox reaction at conserved
  cysteine residues which results in the creation of disulfide bonds. Recently the
  thiol-redox reaction of Prdxs has also been implicated in several cell signaling
  systems. Here we report the cloning and expression patterns during development of
  six peroxiredoxin homologs from the frog X. laevis. Sequence analysis confirmed
  their identity as well as their evolutionary relationship with peroxiredoxins from
  several other species. Using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analysis we have shown
  that there is early and robust expression of all six homologs during development.
  All six X. laevis peroxiredoxins are expressed in neural regions including the brain,
  eyes, as well as the somites. Different expression patterns for each peroxiredoxin
  are also observed in the pronephric region, including the proximal and distal tubules.
  Expression of several peroxiredoxins was also observed in the blood precursors and
  the olfactory placode. These results suggest important roles for all six peroxiredoxins
  during early development. These roles may be restricted to their functions as anti-oxidant
  enzymes, but may also be related to their emerging roles in redox signaling.
