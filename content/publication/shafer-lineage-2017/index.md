abstract: During prostate development, basal and luminal cell lineages are generated
  through symmetric and asymmetric divisions of bipotent basal cells. However, the
  extent to which spindle orientation controls division symmetry or cell fate, and
  the upstream factors regulating this process, are still elusive. We report that
  GATA3 is expressed in both prostate basal progenitor and luminal cells and that
  loss of GATA3 leads to a mislocalization of PRKCZ, resulting in mitotic spindle
  randomization during progenitor cell division. Inherently proliferative intermediate
  progenitor cells accumulate, leading to an expansion of the luminal compartment.
  These defects ultimately result in a loss of tissue polarity and defective branching
  morphogenesis. We further show that disrupting the interaction between PRKCZ and
  PARD6B is sufficient to recapitulate the spindle and cell lineage phenotypes. Collectively,
  these results identify a critical role for GATA3 in prostate lineage specification,
  and further highlight the importance of regulating spindle orientation for hierarchical
  cell lineage organization.
