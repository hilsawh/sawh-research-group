abstract: Tissue homeostasis relies on the fine regulation between stem and progenitor
  cell maintenance and lineage commitment. In the adult prostate, stem cells have
  been identified in both basal and luminal cell compartments. However, basal stem/progenitor
  cell homeostasis is still poorly understood. We show that basal stem/progenitor
  cell maintenance is regulated by a balance between BMP5 self-renewal signal and
  GATA3 dampening activity. Deleting Gata3 enhances adult prostate stem/progenitor
  cells self-renewal capacity in both organoid and allograft assays. This phenotype
  results from a local increase in BMP5 activity in basal cells as shown by the impaired
  self-renewal capacity of Bmp5-deficient stem/progenitor cells. Strikingly, Bmp5
  gene inactivation or BMP signaling inhibition with a small molecule inhibitor are
  also sufficient to delay prostate and skin cancer initiation of Pten-deficient mice.
  Together, these results establish BMP5 as a key regulator of basal prostate stem
  cell homeostasis and identifies a potential therapeutic approach against Pten-deficient
  cancers.
