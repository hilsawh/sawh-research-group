abstract: The ability to profile hundreds of thousands to millions of single cells
  using scRNA-sequencing has revolutionised the fields of cell and developmental biology,
  providing incredible insights into the diversity of forms and functions of cell
  types across many species. These technologies hold the promise of developing detailed
  cell type phylogenies which can describe the evolutionary and developmental relationships
  between cell types across species. This will require sampling of many species and
  taxa using single-cell transcriptomics, and methods to classify cell type homologies
  and diversifications. Many tools currently exist for analyzing single cell data
  and identifying cell types. However, cross-species comparisons are complicated by
  many biological and technical factors. These factors include batch effects common
  to deep-sequencing approaches, well known evolutionary relationships between orthologous
  and paralogous genes, and less well-understood evolutionary forces shaping transcriptome
  variation between species. In this review, I discuss recent developments in computational
  methods for the comparison of single-cell-omic data across species. These approaches
  have the potential to provide invaluable insight into how evolutionary forces act
  at the level of the cell and will further our understanding of the evolutionary
  origins of animal and cellular diversity.
