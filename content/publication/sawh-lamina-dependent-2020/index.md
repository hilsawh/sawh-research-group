abstract: Current models suggest that chromosome domains segregate into either an
  active (A) or inactive (B) compartment. B-compartment chromatin is physically separated
  from the A compartment and compacted by the nuclear lamina. To examine these models
  in the developmental context of C. elegans embryogenesis, we undertook chromosome
  tracing to map the trajectories of entire autosomes. Early embryonic chromosomes
  organized into an unconventional barbell-like configuration, with two densely folded
  B compartments separated by a central A compartment. Upon gastrulation, this conformation
  matured into conventional A/B compartments. We used unsupervised clustering to uncover
  subpopulations with differing folding properties and variable positioning of compartment
  boundaries. These conformations relied on tethering to the lamina to stretch the
  chromosome; detachment from the lamina compacted, and allowed intermingling between,
  A/B compartments. These findings reveal the diverse conformations of early embryonic
  chromosomes and uncover a previously unappreciated role for the lamina in systemic
  chromosome stretching.
