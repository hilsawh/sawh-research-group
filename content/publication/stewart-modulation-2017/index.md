abstract: 'The elimination of unwanted cells by apoptosis is necessary for tissue
  morphogenesis. However, the cellular control of morphogenetic apoptosis is poorly
  understood, notably the modulation of cell sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. Ureter
  maturation, the process by which the ureter is displaced to the bladder wall, represents
  an exquisite example of morphogenetic apoptosis, requiring the receptor protein
  tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs): LAR and RPTPσ. Here we show that LAR-RPTPs act through
  cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1) to modulate caspase 3,7-mediated
  ureter maturation. Pharmacologic or genetic inactivation of cIAP1 reverts the apoptotic
  deficit of LAR-RPTP–deficient embryos. Moreover, Birc2 (cIAP1) inactivation generates
  excessive apoptosis leading to vesicoureteral reflux in newborns, which underscores
  the importance of apoptotic modulation during urinary tract morphogenesis. We finally
  demonstrate that LAR-RPTP deficiency increases cIAP1 stability during apoptotic
  cell death. Together these results identify a mode of cIAP1 regulation playing a
  critical role in the cellular response to apoptotic pathway activation in the embryo.'
