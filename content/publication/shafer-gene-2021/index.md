abstract: Hundreds of cell types form the vertebrate brain but it is largely unknown
  how similar cellular repertoires are between or within species or how cell-type
  diversity evolves. To examine cell-type diversity across and within species, we
  performed single-cell RNA sequencing of ~130,000 hypothalamic cells from zebrafish
  (Danio rerio) and surface and cave morphs of Mexican tetra (Astyanax mexicanus).
  We found that over 75% of cell types were shared between zebrafish and Mexican tetra,
  which diverged from a common ancestor over 150â€‰million years ago. Shared cell types
  displayed shifts in paralogue expression that were generated by subfunctionalization
  after genome duplication. Expression of terminal effector genes, such as neuropeptides,
  was more conserved than the expression of their associated transcriptional regulators.
  Species-specific cell types were enriched for the expression of species-specific
  genes and characterized by the neofunctionalization of expression patterns of members
  of recently expanded or contracted gene families. Comparisons between surface and
  cave morphs revealed differences in immune repertoires and transcriptional changes
  in neuropeptidergic cell types associated with genomic differences. The single-cell
  atlases presented here are a powerful resource to explore hypothalamic cell types
  and reveal how gene family evolution and shifts in paralogue expression contribute
  to cellular diversity.
