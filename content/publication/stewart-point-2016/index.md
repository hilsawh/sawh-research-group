abstract: Rho family GTPases act as molecular switches regulating actin cytoskeleton
  dynamics. Attenuation of their signaling capacity is provided by GTPase-activating
  proteins (GAPs), including p190A, that promote the intrinsic GTPase activity of
  Rho proteins. In the current study we have performed a small-scale ENU mutagenesis
  screen and identified a novel loss of function allele of the p190A gene Arhgap35,
  which introduces a Leu1396 to Gln substitution in the GAP domain. This results in
  decreased GAP activity for the prototypical Rho-family members, RhoA and Rac1, likely
  due to disrupted ordering of the Rho binding surface. Consequently, Arhgap35-deficient
  animals exhibit hypoplastic and glomerulocystic kidneys. Investigation into the
  cystic phenotype shows that p190A is required for appropriate primary cilium formation
  in renal nephrons. P190A specifically localizes to the base of the cilia to permit
  axoneme elongation, which requires a functional GAP domain. Pharmacological manipulations
  further reveal that inhibition of either Rho kinase (ROCK) or F-actin polymerization
  is able to rescue the ciliogenesis defects observed upon loss of p190A activity.
  We propose a model in which p190A acts as a modulator of Rho GTPases in a localized
  area around the cilia to permit the dynamic actin rearrangement required for cilia
  elongation. Together, our results establish an unexpected link between Rho GTPase
  regulation, ciliogenesis and glomerulocystic kidney disease.
