title: 3) Identifying and characterising new sleep genes
date: 2022-01-01
---

We use a combination of more traditional model organisms, as well asa funtional genomic, behavioural, molecular, and circuit based techniques to characterise novel sleep genes identified through our evolutionary comparisons

Identification and characterisation of these genes can lead to fundamental insights into human biology and disease etiology. In this aim we hope ot use both zebrafish and mouse genetic models.
