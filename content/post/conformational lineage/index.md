<p>Using the unparalleled resource of the known <em>C. elegans</em> lineage, we will integrate cellular histories and cell fate branch-points to define cell-type specific genome architectures and generate a <b>‘conformational lineage’</b> of early development. 

Our approach of lineage-resolved chromosome tracing will allow us to predict <b>causal relationships</b> between chromosome conformation, transcription, and cell fate decisions <b>simultaneously in each & every cell</b> of the developing embryo. 

We will test causation hypotheses <em>in situ</em>, in single-cell multimodal assays merging spatial genomics and transcriptomics.</p>
