How are large-scale chromosome conformations built and broken down <em>in vivo</em>?

What is the link between the epigenome and conformation in <em>single cells</em>?

To uncover the genetic and molecular determinants of chromosome compartmentalization, we will profile the epigenome in single cells & exploit the power of <em>C. elegans</em> genetics to identify new players.
