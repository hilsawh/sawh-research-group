<p align="justified" style="color:gray;">We are building a diverse team of scientists. Research in the lab bridges spatial genomics, cell & developmental biology, computational biology, biochemistry & systems biology.</p> 

<p align="justified" style="color:gray;">OPEN POSITIONS:</p> 

<p align="justified" style="color:gray;">

A) Technician/Research Assistant: Ideal for a candidate with MSc-level education, or BSc-level education with full-time wet lab experience, looking for a long-term position. C. elegans expertise is highly advantageous. The technician will help to manage the lab and contribute to research goals.
Start date: May/June 2025 (flexible).

B) Post-doc: Ideal for a candidate with substantial computational biology skills demonstrated by publication record. The postdoc will lead an HFSP-funded project on 'spatial translatomics during development' in collaboration with two other labs (France & UK).
Start date: January 2026.

C) PhD students: Ideal for curious and motivated students interested in studying the functional roles of genome organization during embryonic development. Students must first apply to and be accepted into the rotation-based Biochemistry program at the University of Toronto. Graduate students in our lab have the option to enrich their Biochemistry degree by joining the Collaborative Specialization in Developmental Biology or the Collaborative Specialization in Genome Biology and Bioinformatics.
Start date: September annually

Positions will be full-time, in-person at our lab in MaRS (downtown Toronto, Ontario). 

If you are interested in the Technician or Postdoc position, please reach out to <ahilya.sawh@utoronto.ca> directly by email including:
1. Statement of interest (Why are you interested in our lab? Why are you an ideal candidate?). 
2. Detailed CV. 
3. Names and contact information for 3 (preferably academic) referees, indicating how long you have known each referee and in what capacity.
