<p align="justify">How does one genome generate a large diversity of cell types, each with unique spatiotemporal gene expression patterns and physiological roles? How does the physical organization of the genome impact its many essential functions during the highly dynamic process of embryonic development?</p> 


<p align="justify"> In our lab, we study the <b>functional role of genome organization in animal development at the single-molecule level & across biological scales</b> (molecules &rarr; organelles &rarr; cells &rarr; tissues &rarr; organism).</p>


<p align="justify">We push the boundaries of high-throughput image-based spatial omics, and complement these approaches with biochemistry & genetics. Ultimately, we will answer fundamental questions that were previously untenable and gain mechanistic & quantitative insights into <em>in vivo</em> chromatin biology.</p>
